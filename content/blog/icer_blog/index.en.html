<p>Upon entering my fourth and final year of my PhD studies, I finally attended and presented at my first in-person conference at the International Computing Education Research (<a href="https://icer2022.acm.org/">ICER</a>) conference in Lugano, Switzerland. During my PhD studies, I have presented at three virtual conferences but have never presented or attended an in-person conference due to COVID.</p>
<p>Me and my mentor, <a href="https://twitter.com/lishinskialex">Lexi</a> Lishinski, presented our (with <a href="https://twitter.com/jrosenberg6432">Joshua</a> Rosenberg) paper which was accepted and published in the ICER conference proceedings: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3501385.3543958">Self-efficacy, Interest, and Belongingness – URM Students’ Momentary Experiences in CS</a>. Normally I consider myself a good presenter, but during our presentation I realized that I have never presented in front of a large in-person audience. Our presentation went very well and I am fortunate to have that experience before graduating.</p>
<p>Overall, my first in-person conference experience was enriching and something I know I would not have been able to appreciate or receive if it was held strictly online. I met and made connections with other computer science education, educational psychology, and data science scholars and practitioners from around the world.</p>
<p>Admittedly, while listening to other paper and poster presentations, there were moments where I felt out of place, given that computer science education is not my specific area of study. However, I continually found myself thinking about and asking questions regarding the methodology utilized by the presenters. While specific topics within the CSE field were foreign to me, I took comfort in knowing that I have been trained as a decent methodologist as I continued to focus on the methods in each of the studies.</p>
<p>Having the opportunity to connect with other scholars and practitioners, present at my first in-person conference, and learn about other topics and methods used in the CSE field, ICER 2022 was a fantastic experience to kick-off my final year of studies.</p>
