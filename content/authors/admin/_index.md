Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Sarah and I am a research scientist in the Theory and Practice in Teacher Education (TPTE) department at the University of Tennessee. My current work as a research scientist includes leading the re-design of an R Shiny application which conducts sensitivity analyses for causal inference methods as part of an IES-funded [project](https://ies.ed.gov/funding/grantsearch/details.asp?ID=5723) (R305D220022). Beyond this work, my research interests include survey research, psychometrics, QuantCrit methods, and supporting underserved and underrepresented populations. Other than that, I consider myself an R and Shiny lover.

Feel free to explore my website and don't hesitate to reach out via email, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Thanks for stopping by! :)
